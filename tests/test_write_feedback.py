"""A refused write must not look like an accepted one, and an overridden one must say so.

`_async_update_wifi_adapter` logged a `LuciError` at debug and returned, while
`async_select_option` went on to write the requested value into the entity. A
router that refused the change was therefore indistinguishable from one that took
it - and a mesh controller that answers `code: 0` and puts its own value back
later was indistinguishable from both.

3.6.12 watched for the second case with a counter that disarmed on the first
refresh that agreed, so it only ever caught an immediate revert. On a real mesh
the RA82 leaves undo a change on their own within minutes, and the RD28 leaf kept
one for hours and lost it the moment the main's profile was touched and pushed to
every node. Both went unreported. The request is now remembered for the life of
the entity, and every departure from it is reported once.
